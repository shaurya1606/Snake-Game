# Snake Game

A classic Snake Game implemented in Python. Move the snake around the screen, eat food to grow longer, and avoid colliding with yourself or the walls!

## Features

- Classic snake gameplay
- Score tracking
- Simple and intuitive controls
- Game Over detection

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shaurya1606/Snake-Game.git
   cd Snake-Game
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   - If the game uses external libraries (e.g., `pygame`), install them:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - If there is no `requirements.txt`, you may need to install pygame directly:
     ```bash
     pip install pygame
     ```

## Usage

Run the game with:
```bash
python snake_game.py
```
*(Replace `snake_game.py` with the main Python file if it has a different name.)*

## Controls

- **Arrow keys**: Move the snake (Up, Down, Left, Right)
- **Esc**: Exit the game
